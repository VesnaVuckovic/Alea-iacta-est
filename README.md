Throwing the dice for two players.
A game for two players, who roll one die, which has values ​​from 1 to 6.
Players take turns rolling the dice, until one of them gets a 6. The player who got a 6 rolls the dice again and then starts counting points until he gets a 6 or a 1. If he gets a 6, then the throwing of the dice goes to the other player, and the sum of the collected points is transferred to his bank, and the next roll begins with the sum in the bank and a sum of zero for the new hand of the roll. If he rolled a 1, that hand's total is reset to 0. The first player to reach 101 wins.
